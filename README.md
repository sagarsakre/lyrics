======

Written a small python script which will fetch the lyrics for the given string from web and show it on the console

Just put it in any folder and export the PATH variable. Whenever you feel like checking the song lyrics
you can just type 
$~ lyrics <song-name>
Thats it. Enjoy songs !!!

Note: It works only for the english songs for now. 
      Support for the hindi songs will be brought soon.
